## Data-Driven Product Management: Conducting a Market Analysis

### Project Description 
In this project, I explored local and international markets to find opportunities for my fitness products. I used my data manipulation skills to examine data about online interest in home gyms, gym workouts, home workouts, and fitness products, and created visualizations to help guide my product decisions.

## Analyzing TV Data

### Project Description
In this project, I looked at Super Bowl Data, generating insights into game outcomes, viewership, and even halftime shows. In the unguided variant of this project, I developed an informative plot that helped to visualize the viewership and quality of The Office throughout its nine seasons.

## What's in an Avocado Toast: A Supply Chain Analysis

### Project Description
In this project, I applied my data manipulation and analysis skills to conduct a supply chain analysis of the ingredients used in an avocado toast, using the Open Food Facts database. This database contains extensive, openly-sourced information on various foods, including their origins. Through this analysis, I gained an in-depth understanding of the complex supply chain involved in producing a single dish.

## Getting a Good Night's Sleep

### Project Description
Sleep is essential for both physical and mental health. Quality sleep repairs cells, consolidates memories, wards off disease, and much more.
In this project, I worked as a data science consultant for SleepInc, a sleep-tracking startup. My mission was to analyze anonymous sleep data from their SleepScope app to uncover insights into lifestyle factors affecting sleep quality and duration.


## Exploring the History of Lego
### Project Description
In this project, I explored the Rebrickable database, which includes data on every LEGO set that has ever been sold. The dataset contains information such as the names of the sets, the bricks they contain, the colors of the bricks, and more. Though the bricks may be small, this is big data! Throughout the project, I answered a series of questions related to the history of Lego using the Rebrickable database.

## Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores

### Project Description
Every year, school test results impact the college admissions fate of millions of students.
In this project, I used standardized test performance data from NYC's public schools to identify the schools with top math results, look at how performance varies by borough, and find the city's top ten performing schools!

## Debugging a Sales Data Workflow

### Project Description
In this project, I worked to fix the start of a sales workflow. I needed to read an already-written code, understand where the problem was, and come up with a solution so things could run smoothly again.

## The GitHub History of the Scala Language

### Project Description
In this project, I was challenged to read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala. This repository spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. My task was to find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.
The dataset included the project history of Scala retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files.


## Generating Keywords for Search Campaigns

### Project Description
In this project, I practiced how to automatically generate keywords for a search engine marketing campaign using Python. The goal was to send website visitors to the right landing page by targeting specific keywords that match their search queries.

## Which Debts Are Worth the Bank's Effort?

### Project Description
After a debt had been legally declared "uncollectable" by a bank, the account was considered to be "charged-off." However, the bank didn't simply walk away from the debt; they still aimed to collect some of the money they were owed.
In this project, I delved into a scenario where a bank assigned delinquent customers to different recovery strategies based on the expected amount the bank believed it would recover from the customer. The goal for the data scientist was to determine, in this non-random assignment, whether the incremental amount the bank earned exceeded the additional cost of assigning customers to a higher recovery strategy.
Threshold assignments like this also occurred in other domains such as medicine (e.g., above a certain temperature, a patient received medicine), education (e.g., above a certain test score, students got admitted to a special class), other areas of finance (e.g., above a certain wealth, customers got different levels of service), and the public sector (e.g., below a certain income, someone was eligible for housing benefits). Regression discontinuity was an intuitive and useful analysis method in any situation involving a threshold assignment.
